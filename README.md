# Simple Translator - A Command-Line Language Tool (Educational Project)

## ðŸ§  About the Project

This Simple Translator is a command-line language translation tool developed in C as an educational project. It provides users with the ability to build, modify, and utilize a personalized dictionary for translating words and phrases across multiple languages.

The core functionality includes:

* **Dictionary Management:** Users can add, edit, and delete translation entries.
* **Multi-Language Support:** The system is designed to handle translations between various languages defined by the user.
* **Translation Capabilities:** Translate individual words, complete sentences, and even the content of text files based on the user-defined dictionary.
* **Data Storage:** Employs fundamental C data structures like structs and arrays to efficiently store and organize translation pairs.
* **File Input/Output:** Features for importing dictionary data from external files and exporting the current dictionary for backup or sharing.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A menu-driven command-line interface for easy interaction with the translator's features.
* **Basic Translation Logic:** Implements straightforward lookup mechanisms to find and apply translations based on the dictionary.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project serves as a practical application of fundamental programming concepts in C, including:

* **Structured Data Handling:** Utilizing `struct` and arrays to represent and manage translation data.
* **String Manipulation:** Implementing functions for processing and comparing text.
* **File I/O in C:** Demonstrating how to read from and write to files for data persistence.
* **Menu-Based User Interaction:** Designing a command-line interface that guides the user through different functionalities.
* **Basic Translation Logic:** Developing the core algorithms for looking up and applying translations.
* **Simulating Real-World Systems:** Providing a simplified model of a dictionary or translation system where users manage their own data.

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

**This project was created solely for educational purposes.** The translation accuracy is entirely dependent on the dictionary entries manually created and maintained by the user. It does **not** utilize external translation APIs, machine learning models, or large language models. The translations provided are limited to the vocabulary and translations explicitly entered by the user.

**A full license text would typically be included in a separate `LICENSE` file. The above is a summary for the `README`.**

**Why this license?**

This type of restrictive license is often used for educational projects where the primary goal is learning and demonstration, rather than open-source collaboration or commercialization. It allows others to benefit from the code for their own learning while protecting the original creator's intent and preventing unauthorized commercial exploitation.

**To implement this fully, you would:**

1.  **Create a `LICENSE` file** in the root of your project.
2.  **Include the full legal text** of a custom Non-Commercial, Attribution Required license within that file. You might need to consult legal resources or adapt existing non-commercial licenses to fit your specific needs.
3.  **Ensure the `README.md` clearly references the `LICENSE` file** and summarizes the key restrictions as done above.
4.  **Include a copyright notice** in your code files, typically at the beginning of each file, referencing the license.
