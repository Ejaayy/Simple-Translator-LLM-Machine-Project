ðŸ§  About the Project
This Simple Translator is a command-line language translation tool written in C, developed as a school project. 
It allows users to create, edit, and manage their own dictionary of word translations between multiple languages. 
The program supports translating individual words, full sentences, and even content from text files.
It uses basic data structures like structs and arrays to store translation pairs and manage entries. 
File handling features allow the import and export of dictionary data, while various utility functions make the translation and filtering process efficient.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The main goal of this project is to apply core programming concepts such as:
-Structured data handling (struct, arrays)
-String manipulation

File I/O in C
-Menu-based user interaction
-Basic translation logic without the use of external APIs
-This project simulates a mini-dictionary or translator system where users have full control over the language data they input.

ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer
This project was created purely for educational purposes. 
The translations are based on user-provided input and are not powered by machine learning or LLMs. 
Accuracy depends on the dictionary entries manually added by the user.
