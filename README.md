# Simple Translator - A Command-Line Language Tool (Educational Project)

## 🧠 About the Project

This Simple Translator is a command-line language translation tool developed in C as an educational project. It provides users with the ability to build, modify, and utilize a personalized dictionary for translating words and phrases across multiple languages.

The core functionality includes:

* **Dictionary Management:** Users can add, edit, and delete translation entries.
* **Multi-Language Support:** The system is designed to handle translations between various languages defined by the user.
* **Translation Capabilities:** Translate individual words, complete sentences, and even the content of text files based on the user-defined dictionary.
* **Data Storage:** Employs fundamental C data structures like structs and arrays to efficiently store and organize translation pairs.
* **File Input/Output:** Features for importing dictionary data from external files and exporting the current dictionary for backup or sharing.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A menu-driven command-line interface for easy interaction with the translator's features.
* **Basic Translation Logic:** Implements straightforward lookup mechanisms to find and apply translations based on the dictionary.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a practical application of fundamental programming concepts in C, including:

* **Structured Data Handling:** Utilizing `struct` and arrays to represent and manage translation data.
* **String Manipulation:** Implementing functions for processing and comparing text.
* **File I/O in C:** Demonstrating how to read from and write to files for data persistence.
* **Menu-Based User Interaction:** Designing a command-line interface that guides the user through different functionalities.
* **Basic Translation Logic:** Developing the core algorithms for looking up and applying translations.
* **Simulating Real-World Systems:** Providing a simplified model of a dictionary or translation system where users manage their own data.

## 📌 Disclaimer
This project was created solely for educational purposes and academic submission. The translation logic depends entirely on a custom dictionary manually created by the user. It does not use external translation APIs or AI models. The output is limited to the exact vocabulary manually input by the user.
